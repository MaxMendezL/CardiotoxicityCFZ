The codes for the analysis of data from Carfilzomib-related cardiotoxicity published in (...) are presented here. 


1) Processed Seurat files from scRNAseq analysis are shared as .rds files: "CFZATRAvsVehicle", "CFZvsCFZATRA", "CFZvsVehicle" in Figshare. The code used for Data processing is provided as "scRNAseq.R".

2) A code for murine ECG Analysis was used. A Shinny example can be found in: https://maxmendezl.shinyapps.io/ShinnyApp/. The scripts as well as examples of processed data necessary to run the app con be found here under "Codes".
