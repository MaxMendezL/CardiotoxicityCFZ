# Carfilzomib induced cardiotoxicity


The codes for the analysis of data from Carfilzomib-related cardiotoxicity are presented here. 


1) Processed Seurat files from scRNAseq analysis are shared as .rds files: "CFZATRAvsVehicle", "CFZvsCFZATRA", "CFZvsVehicle" in Figshare: https://figshare.com/collections/Carfilzomib_mediated_cardiotoxicity/6716034.
2)  The R code for the analysis of the ECG as well as example files are provided as the .zip file "CardiotoxicityCFZ". All data is accesible under the following link: https://figshare.com/collections/Carfilzomib_mediated_cardiotoxicity/6716034.
